// flutter pub run build_runner watch -> used to build .g files for json sterilization of models

// "flutter packages pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs" but it throws a "Invalid argument(s): name shouldn't end with a '.'" error. -> this error had eaten almost 1hr of my time and i couldn't find the reason. After a lot of research, I found out that there was a file "transaction..dart" lol hahahahaha.
